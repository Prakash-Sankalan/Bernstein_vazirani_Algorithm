# Bernstein_vazirani_Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in Python. The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is a quantum algorithm that solves a specific problem faster than classical algorithms. In particular, it efficiently determines the hidden bitstring in an oracle function.

Overview:

The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm solves the following problem: Given a black-box oracle function f(x) that takes an n-bit string x as input and produces a single bit as output, find the n-bit string s such that f(x) = s · x (where · denotes the bitwise dot product modulo 2). Classical algorithms would require O(n) queries to determine the hidden bitstring, but the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm accomplishes this in a single query.

Dependencies:

This implementation relies on standard Python libraries and does not require any additional dependencies.
